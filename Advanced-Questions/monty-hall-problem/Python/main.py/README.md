# Monty Hall problem :door:
**Monty's Here! Monty knows everything. :ghost:**\
Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle in which you challenge yourself to find the car. :car:

## Game Direction
Monty is the game host. He knows everything. He asks you to choose one of the three doors. 
Behind two of them, there are two goats but behind one of them, there is your fancy prize which is a car.\
\
After you make your first selection, Monty tells you where one of the goats is located. Then he offers you to switch to the other door. You can either stick to your first selection or switch.
\
Whether you stick to your selection, Monty will open the two other doors. If a goat is behind your door, you lose, otherwise, the car is yours! ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯ ðŸ’¯

### Game Tip!
It is recommended always to switch as there is a higher probability for the car to be behind the door you have not chosen. To understand the probabilities in this game watch [this video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/4Lb-6rxZxx0).

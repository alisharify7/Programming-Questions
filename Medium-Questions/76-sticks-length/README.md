There are n sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length.
You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations cost x where x is the difference between the new and original length.
What is the minimum total cost?
Input
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of sticks.
Then there are n integers: p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n: the lengths of the sticks.
Output
Print one integer: the minimum total cost.
Constraints

1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5
1 \le p_i \le 10^9

Example
Input:
5
2 3 1 5 2

Output:
